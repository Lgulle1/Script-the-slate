# Overnight plan (written while you sleep; updated as each step finishes)

You asked me to keep going one phase at a time and not to start a phase until the previous one is bug-proof. The spec is
`docs/build_plan.md` (committed from your upload). Every step is committed and pushed as it finishes. Standing rules: pure track only; 2025
never loaded; raw pulls append-only; results byte-identical on a second run before they are committed; older result versions never overwritten;
no market dropped; no threshold tuned to flip a verdict; no PRs.

## Order of work
1. **4c.3 finished and bug-proofed** (in progress): conformance with the plan, two from-scratch builds byte-identical, the search log run twice,
   an independent code review, every confirmed bug fixed test-first, the full suite.
2. **4c.4 standardized residuals and shifts**, then its own verification.
3. **4c.5 input-share tracking** (feature wiring into the volume and efficiency models, like 4a.4), then its own verification.
4. **4c.6 window selection and the comparables ablation** (`run_comps_ablation.py`), run twice, byte-identical, CLEARS gate applied per market.
5. **4d.0 stops for you**: the plan says to list the coaching-history sources and their terms and STOP for your review before collecting anything.
   If there is time I will prepare that list (no collection).
6. **4e.1 weather**: independent of 4d. I will only start it if 4c is finished and verified, and I'll say so here.

## What I changed in 4c.3 to match the plan (it was built before you sent the plan)
- S2 and S5 are two-sided: weight = offense similarity x defense similarity (plan 4c.4). In S2 the defense is tonight's opponent itself, compared
  with what it was in the past game. S5 compares the offense side and the defense side of the interaction profile separately.
- Continuity comes from `features/weights.py` for the market in every search, not only in S1. A past game of another team flags every factor,
  so it carries the product of the whole penalty row.
- S5 sigma is estimated over the matchups the S5 pool admits (every FTN feature present). Before, it also counted 2016-2021 rows.
- A game without 4a expectations (2 of 2,688) falls back to the healthy target vector instead of counting the units as missing.

## What the independent code review found in 4c.1-4c.3, and the fixes
An independent review (a separate agent, read-only) went through 4c.1-4c.3. Every confirmed finding was fixed test-first: a test that fails on the
old code, then the fix. I checked each new test by putting its bug back: it fails.
1. **Leak: a target who did not play had no vector.** Archetype vectors existed only for player-games in which the player played, so a scored target
   (2020-2024) who then sat out had no vector, and "has a vector" told the search he played. 515 targets had no offensive snap and 69 more played at
   another position. Fix: every scored target gets a vector built from his earlier games, whether or not he played; the row is flagged `is_target`,
   and only rows flagged `in_pool` (he played) are ever observations of later searches.
2. **Leak: the league mean and SD of week W used the players who played in week W.** The archetype z-scores of week W were standardised over the
   players who turned out to play that week. Fix: the week's mean / SD and the shrinkage mean come from that week's PREGAME depth chart (every team-week
   2016-2024 has one). Test: removing a player's week-W game changes no other player's week-W vector.
3. **S5 player markets counted one past game several times.** S5 compares team-game matchups, so every receiver of a past game had the same S5
   similarity and n_eff counted the game once per receiver. Fix: n_eff counts historical team-games (the cap of 4c.4 is per team-game too). Team
   targets are unchanged (one observation per team-game). This is the one fix that changes a plan formula's reading; see decision 5 below.
4. **RB2 carry share was missing, not 0, in bell-cow games** (one back took every carry). Fix: 0 over the RB carries.
5. Smaller: the EXTENDED space was chosen even when its sigma did not exist yet (now BASE, as for team units); the median best similarity in the
   no-match log sorted missing values above every value; the matches table had no tie-break on the player id; S3 and S4 excluded the target's own
   games and tonight's defense, which the plan does not say (S3 says "on any team"), so the exclusions are gone.
6. Not run before: the plan's healthy-vs-adjusted comparison (4c.1.4). It now runs for every target and search in 4c.4 and is stored: overlap of the
   top 10 matches, shared weight, whether no_match flips, change in the volume and efficiency shifts.

## Things I need you to decide (I have not decided them)
1. **The no-match calibration.** At SIM_THRESHOLD = 0.70 almost every search returns no_match (numbers in the 4c.3 log). The plan lets the
   constants be tuned only on 2020-2024 walk-forward results, never per target. I am not tuning anything; 4c.4-4c.6 run on the starting values,
   and I'll add a sensitivity table so you can see what each option would do.
2. **Pool expectations for 2016-2019.** 4c.4's z needs a comp-free expected value for every matched observation. `walkforward_predictions`
   (3.5.3) covers only 2020-2024 scored rows. Extending it means moving FEATURE_HISTORY_START to 2016, which 3.5.2b reserves for a later decision.
   Until then, matches without an expectation are retrieved but carry no z, so the shift uses only matches that have one.
3. **S3 "one-sided".** Plan 4c.4 lists S3 as one-sided, but S3's definition names two resemblances (the player's archetype and the defense
   faced). I use archetype similarity x defense similarity as S3's single similarity; say if you meant otherwise.
4. **Side similarity over several units** (for example the five offense units of rush_att) is the mean of the unit similarities. The plan does
   not fix this.
5. **n_eff over historical team-games.** The plan's n_eff = (sum w)^2 / sum(w^2) does not say what one observation is. For a player market several
   players of one past game can match (always in S5, where they share one matchup similarity). I sum the weights of each past team-game before the
   formula, so one game is one observation's worth of evidence; this drives both the no-match rule (MIN_NEFF = 2) and the shrinkage n/(n+5). Counting
   player-games instead is a one-line change (`cluster_neff`) if you prefer it.
6. **S1 and the across-search team cap.** Plan 4c.4.3 caps any historical team at a 15% average share across the five searches. S1 is the target's
   own past games, so its own team holds 100% of S1 by definition: with S1 counted, the cap can never hold (that team averages at least 20%), and the
   capping loop pushed that team's weight toward zero in S2-S5. I exempt S1 from the across-search average (it keeps the 25% per-team-game cap) and
   still divide by five. Say if you read the rule differently.
7. **Expectations exist only for scored rows.** The comp-free expectations (3.5.3) exist for the scored 2020-2024 player-games and team sides. A
   matched past game of a player who was not a scored target that day (for example a WR4) has no z and does not move the shift. This is the same
   limit as decision 2, for non-scored players.

## Log
- 4c.3: S2/S5 two-sided, continuity in every search, S5 sigma fix, fallback to healthy. 50 tests pass. Vectors rebuilt twice with the
  played-population fix: all six outputs byte-identical.
